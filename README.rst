**PySparse: A Fast Sparse Matrix Library for Python
(Commonsense Computing version)**

Pysparse is a fast sparse matrix library for Python. It provides several sparse
matrix storage formats and conversion methods. It also implements a number of
iterative solvers, preconditioners, and interfaces to efficient factorization
packages. Both low-level and high-level interfaces are available, each with
different strengths.

This is not the official source to PySparse. This is csc-pysparse, a downstream
package maintained by the Commonsense Computing Group
(http://csc.media.mit.edu) with the goal of making it install automatically
through Pip or easy_install.
