"""
A framework for solving sparse linear systems of equations using an LU
factorization, by means of the supernodal sparse LU factorization package
SuperLU ([DEGLL99]_, [DGL99]_, [LD03]_).

This package is appropriate for factorizing sparse square unsymmetric or
rectangular matrices.

See [SLU]_ for more information.

    `PysparseSuperLUSolver` is a wrapper class around the SuperLu library for
    the factorization of full-rank n-by-m matrices. Only matrices with real
    coefficients are currently supported.

    :parameters:

       :A: The matrix to be factorized, supplied as a PysparseMatrix instance.

    :keywords:

       :symmetric: a boolean indicating that the user wishes to use symmetric
                   mode. In symmetric mode, ``permc_spec=2`` must be chosen and
                   ``diag_pivot_thresh`` must be small, e.g., 0.0 or 0.1. Since
                   the value of ``diag_pivot_thresh`` is up to the user, setting
                   ``symmetric`` to ``True`` does *not* automatically set
                   ``permc_spec`` and ``diag_pivot_thresh`` to appropriate
                   values.

       :diag_pivot_thresh: a float value between 0 and 1 representing the
                           threshold for partial pivoting (0 = no pivoting,
                           1 = always perform partial pivoting). Default: 1.0.

       :drop_tol: the value of a drop tolerance, between 0 and 1, if an
                  incomplete factorization is desired (0 = exact factorization).
                  This keyword does not exist if using SuperLU version 2.0 and
                  below. In more recent version of SuperLU, the keyword is
                  accepted but has no effect. Default: 0.0

       :relax: an integer controling the degree of relaxing supernodes.
               Default: 1.

       :panel_size: an integer specifying the maximum number of columns to form
                    a panel. Default: 10.

       :permc_spec: an integer specifying the ordering strategy used during the
                    factorization.

       The CPU time to perform the factorization.

       The CPU time to perform the forward and backward sweeps.
